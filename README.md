- DATA_pour-tear-gas-on-fire_PSRM_Stata_Shapefile.dta: this contains the shapefiles in Stata binary format to generate the contiguity matrices for the S-2SLS models.
- DATA_maps.RDS: this file contains the shapefile and the relevant variables from the main dataset (tgfreq, yoshinoya) to generate the three maps (Figures 1, A1 and A2) in the manuscript.

## Scripts

- DO_pour-tear-gas-on-fire_PSRM.do: contains code in STATA to reproduce all figures and tables, except Figures 1, A1 and A2.
- R_Maps_Replication.R: contains code in R to reproduce Figures 1, A1 and A2.
